TODO:

- [ ] F: Try validation to calculate on darkness not only from the center, but evenutaly from the oposite side of the glyph.
         Currently it only calculates from the center, which probably is not accurate measurement source.
- [ ] F: Try to implement blur algorithm to calculate the darkness of the glyph as an alternative to the SDF.
